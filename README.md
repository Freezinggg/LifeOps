# LifeOps v1

LifeOps is a personal life operating system designed to help a single user
observe, reflect, and improve their life deliberately.

It focuses on structured reflection rather than productivity hacks,
motivation, or automation.

## Why LifeOps
Most self-improvement tools optimize actions without understanding context.
LifeOps starts with awareness — capturing how life is actually experienced
(day by day) before attempting any optimization.

## Scope of v1
LifeOps v1 is intentionally minimal. It supports:
- Recording personal reflections
- Tracking mood and energy levels
- Reviewing past reflections over time

What v1 will NOT do:
- Habit automation
- Goal tracking
- AI coaching or recommendations
- Multi-user support
